# Stock_Price_Classification
My attempt at predicting daily stock price movements with classification models.

In each version, I will attempt to use more advanced data cleaning methods, technical indicators, and classification methods. My ultimate goal is to build a classification model that performs better than random guessing, and if I'm lucky, one that could produce a profitable trading strategy.
